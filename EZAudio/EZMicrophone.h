/**
 The delegate for the EZMicrophone provides a receiver for the incoming audio data events. When the microphone has been successfully internally configured it will try to send its delegate an AudioStreamBasicDescription describing the format of the incoming audio data. 
 
 The audio data itself is sent back to the delegate in various forms:
 
   -`microphone:hasAudioReceived:withBufferSize:withNumberOfChannels:`
     Provides float arrays instead of the AudioBufferList structure to hold the audio data. There could be a number of float arrays depending on the number of channels (see the function description below). These are useful for doing any visualizations that would like to make use of the raw audio data.
 
   -`microphone:hasBufferList:withBufferSize:withNumberOfChannels:`
     Provides the AudioBufferList structures holding the audio data. These are the native structures Core Audio uses to hold the buffer information and useful for piping out directly to an output (see EZOutput).
