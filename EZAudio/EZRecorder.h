 To ensure valid recording formats are used when recording to a file the EZRecorderFileType describes the most common file types that a file can be encoded in. Each of these types can be used to output recordings as such:
 
 EZRecorderFileTypeAIFF - .aif, .aiff, .aifc, .aac
 EZRecorderFileTypeM4A  - .m4a, .mp4
 EZRecorderFileTypeWAV  - .wav

 The EZRecorder provides a flexible way to create an audio file and append raw audio data to it. The EZRecorder will convert the incoming audio on the fly to the destination format so no conversion is needed between this and any other component. Right now the only supported output format is 'caf'. Each output file should have its own EZRecorder instance (think 1 EZRecorder = 1 audio file).
